    description: "The ACM's website doesn't maintain itself! Even if you don't have any experiance in webcoding, you can still make huge contributions to the project! We need people willing to: write content for the website like the descriptions for the workshops, take notes during meetings and add it to the website so if others missed the meeting they can still be informed about what we covered, help develop and debug sections of the website.  Notes and descriptions do not have to be long, could even be bullet points for the notes, but your efforts would go a long way in helping us out.  What ever you can help out with will also be a learning opportunity for you! -webmeister"
