Have you ever thought of computers being so fast that any program could be run
in a split second and artificial intelligence (like in the Iron Man movie
series) were possible? Right now it may just seem like a twinkle in the
eye of an optimistic visionary, but it may just be more possible than one might
think. With the isolation of graphene in 2004 at the University of Manchester,
the dream of faster and smaller built computers may soon possible. But how
will this new isolate of carbon drastically change computer processors and
how much different is it compared to the past and present computer
processors?

The first obvious difference in computer processors from at least ten years ago
is the size. A normally priced common processor in the year 2004 may have taken
a space up of about a 2 inch by 2 inch square. That’s excluding the size of the
cooling systems, which were also behemoths and taking up almost the entire
upper portion of the mother board. Also these older processors contained only
the processor. The front side bus was not integrated and many of them had only
one core working at a whopping 2 GHz for a high end processor. Without
integration, processors worked slower. For an example, when someone orders a
pizza and has it delivered to their house, it would take a much longer time for
the customer to receive the pizza than if they were in the actual store itself.
Precious speed is lost in the carrying of data between one piece of technology
and the other.

The processors of today have come a long way since ten years ago. Today our
processors have multiple cores ranging from two to sixteen cores. Cores
are like separate processors working together and all integrated into one super
processor. So two cores have two processors built in working in tandem. Also,
computer processors have been miniaturized to be able to fit in phones and
tablets. This is available by new technology like enhanced robotics working
in factories as well as various other machines for micro constructions. One
big issue with making processor units smaller involves the silicon
transistors. A transistor is a component used to switch an electronic
signal and is what creates the binary 0’s and 1’s that the computer uses to
communicate. _“Shrinking transistors delivered corresponding clock speed
increases and more transistors in the same chip area. Architects used the
transistor bounty to add memory, prefetching, branch prediction, multiple
instruction issue, and deeper pipelines. The result was exponential
single-treaded performance improvements.”_ - [Esmaeilzadeh](http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2012/7/151220-looking-back-and-looking-forward/abstract).

Basically, this states that to get more speed is to decrease the transistor
size and to increase the quantity of the transistors in the core. But where is
the fan and how do these micro processors stay cool?  Well the new processors
are positioned on the mother board of the phone or tablet so that they are
closer to the case of the device. Then the case is built with a material that
breaths well and conducts temperature so that the movement of you taking your
device out of your pocket will actually assist in cooling it down. At the same
time though, the new processors don’t put out very much heat unless they are
being really worked.  One might ask why companies don’t build desktop computers
with micro processors. The answer to that is that those micro processors can
only work so fast and processes a smaller amount of data than the normal sized
ones. Although these micro processors run faster than the top of the line super
computers ten years ago, it is still better to run a full sized one in your
home computer.

The processors of tomorrow will be something spectacular. Scientists have been
hard at work, constantly attempting to change and increase the speed of the
future computers. These ideas range from using biological computers with
limitless speed and power, to using new elements to work a processor faster.
One new material is a compound that scientist have just recently found an
isotope for. It’s called graphene. It is a single atom thick material derived
from carbon that is super conductive. When it was applied to computer
processors, it clocked at almost 420 GHz! That’s more than 10 times the fastest
speed clocked today! Just think of the future of computers if they were all
running this fast. No more waiting for your computer to start a hefty program
or even to start up.

All this is made possible because of switching the transistor material. The
current transistor material is made from silicon and is 32-nanometers big
. It is getting more and more difficult to decrease the size of standard
silicon transistors. How does graphene make a difference in transistor size and
core speed? A quote from Miran Pavic’s article, [Graphene Defects Could Lead to
Smaller Electronics](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/04/graphene-defects-could-lead-to-smaller-electronics), states that “In the last few years, graphene, a form of
carbon derived from graphite oxide, has emerged as a promising alternative to
silicon. It’s one atom thick and has phenomenal electron mobility – roughly 100
times greater than silicon.” The article goes on to explain how graphene made
transistors were built by scientists two years ago and where three times
smaller than the smallest built ones today.  In 2008, two University of
Manchester scientists created a 1-nanometer graphene transistor, [only one atom
thick and 10 atoms across](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/graphene/#ixzz11XeXWfpL).
This has been the smallest transistor
ever built and is claimed to be the absolute physical limit of Moore’s Law
which states that the number of transistors in a processor is affordably
doubled every two years. Basically, as the number of transistors
increases in a chip, the smaller the transistors have to be.

The next big question is why is this not applied to modern electronics yet?
This is because of any new inventions initial issue; finding cheap effective
ways to mass produce it. Graphene is not quite as simple to produce compared to
making an iPhone or any modern computer technology because just about all of
the modern computer technology that is produced today is still based on
technology created a decade ago and is miniaturized. "The Manchester team that
created the 1-nanometer graphene transistor first produced graphene in 2004 by
repeatedly peeling away graphite strips with adhesive tape to isolate a single
atomic plane." - [Carmody](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/10/graphene/#ixzz11XeXWfpL).
To attempt to upscale this method would cause the
production of graphene to be too expensive to use on a wide spectrum of
electronics and it would still cost a fortune to buy those select few products.
Nevertheless, Elizabeth Svoboda from Discover Magazine writes that "Within five
years, it could begin powering faster and better transistors, computer chips,
and LCD screens, according to researchers who are smitten with this new
supermaterial."

Much of the research that is being conducted today on graphene has been
concentrated on finding effective methods of isolation. No one is really sure
of its full capabilities and how long it will take to discover an effective
process of isolation but there is no doubt that it will have a huge effect on
the world in more ways that can be imagined.
<!-- And as MIT chemical engineer
[Michael Strano told Discover magazine](http://discovermagazine.com/2010/jan-feb/07#.UwpndXm5hmY),
“Graphene is an out-of-the-box material, so we shouldn’t try to hammer it into existing boxes.”
