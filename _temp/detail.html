      Declaring types and being restricted by the type system is often cited as a
      negative aspect of C++. I think this is an unfair assessment: a type system
      can make a programmer’s life considerably easier if it’s embraced instead of
      fought, as we’re seeing with the rise in popularity of Haskell. But C++,
      despite all its warts, has a pretty formidable type system of its own
