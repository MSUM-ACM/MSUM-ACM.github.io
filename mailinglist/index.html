<p><em> The school only allows singups via our old rusty list serve. Here
  are instructions to help you out.</em> </p>

<p>We send out important information about our events, workshops, talks and meetings via email on our mailing list.
To stay in the loop, we highly recommend subscribing to the list.</p>


<h2>Subscribing</h2>
<p>Head over to our <a
href="http://lists.mnstate.edu/mailman/listinfo/msumacm">group's mailing list signup page</a>. It
should look something like this.</p>


<div class="article-image">
    <img src="/assets/img/mail-screenshot-1.png" alt="Signup Page SCreenshot"/>
</div>


<p>Once you're on that page, fill in the form with your email address and name.
No one except ACM officers and administrators can access this information, so
it is fairly safe. You do not necessarily have to pick a password. If you
haven't, a password will be mailed to you.  You might not have to cisit this
page often, so just in case you forgot the password you used, the following
section will come of help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Subscriptions are purged every semester so do sign up again at the beginning of every semeseter to recieve our weekly emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Password Reminders, Unsubscribing and other Subscription Options</h2>

<p>Head back to the
<a href="http://lists.mnstate.edu/mailman/listinfo/msumacm">group's mailing list
signup page</a> and look for the field in the bottom. Fill in your email and
hit the button to select an option to get a password reminder, unsibscribe or
change other options.  <p>
