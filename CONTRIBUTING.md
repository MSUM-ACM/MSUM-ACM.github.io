# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code to the website you can do so through GitHub by
joining the organization, contacting an officer and becoming a part of the website team.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

## Updates

As the organization grows so will the GitHub and website. Please refer to the [projects]
section to see if any projects are available and any issues or notes are open or in progress.
If you think of a change or addition feel free to navigate to [issues] and open a new issue as
a suggestion.

## Branching Strategy 

The website is published from `master`

If there is any discomfort or worry feel free to create your own branch such as `dev-John`
to contribute to

`master`:
* Should never be directly contributed too

`dev`:
* Used for new additions to the website

`SemYearUpdate`:
* Follows the naming convention of SemesterYearUpdate pertaining to the school semester and year
    * i.e., Spr2019Update, Fal2020Update 
* Used in conjunction with corresponding [projects]

## Pull Requests

`master` should only ever be merged to through Pull Requests. Currently `master` has a protection
rule that requires two approved reviews before the pull request can be merged.
