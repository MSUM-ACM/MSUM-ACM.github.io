summary: "This project is aimed to fix the issue with the complexity of how to add content to the current website.  It will allow someone to easily create new workshops, add meeting notes, add students works, and more!"
---

<h5>Reason for the project</h5>
The goal of this project is to make it easier to add content to our website.  The current system involves creating a markdown file with a name that follows very specific rules in how it can be named, as well as setting a couple of front matter variables.  It is very easy to make a mistake in the process of creating content.  It also takes quite some time for someone to become familiar with the website layout and where/how content is created and added.  

<h5>How it will work</h5>
This project will be able to create any sort of content that the website needs.  This involves: workshops, alerts, meeting notes, articles, projects, and research.  The plan is to make a simple java GUI that is easy enough to understand that anybody could add content to the website.  We want everything to be acomplished through this GUI, NO COMMAND LINE.  Some people are not yet comfortable with the command line or do not know enough about programs like Git and Jekyll.  This program should have an option to install and configure the correct gems to build the website as well as an option, after Jekyll is installed, for the user to view local changes by utilizing Jekyll's serve command and opening a web browser to the users local copy of the website.  There should also be a final submit button that will commit changes to github.  

<h5>Things that still need to be done</h5>

 * install and configure gems
 * Git push
 * Windows Support -almost done
 * Test for MAC OSx -should work just fine


##The first release is out for Linux
###May work for MAC OSx but not tested
