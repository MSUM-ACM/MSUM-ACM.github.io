# Welcome to the MSUM ACM
The MSUM ACM organization is a computer club for MSU Moorhead.  We take part in competitions, host pizza parties, present workshops on various technology, and much more!  Meetings occur on {{ site.data.basicinfo.meeting_day }} {{ site.data.basicinfo.meeting_occurance }} at {{ site.data.basicinfo.meeting_time }} in {{ site.data.basicinfo.room }}.  If you can't make it to the meetings, feel free to stop by {{ site.data.basicinfo.room }} to talk to us as we are usually there at most hours of the day.
