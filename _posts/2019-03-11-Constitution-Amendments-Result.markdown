### Constitution Amendments Poll Results

Two weeks ago the MSUM ACM Officers opened a poll on Dragon Central to vote for and against certain amendments.

<br />
The votes have been counted, and under the previous Consitution rules the following amendments have been approved and
are currently being reviewed by the Office of Student Activities and the Student Council.

<br />
* Amend the Constitution to one election a year
    * Nearly all organizations at MSUM have yearly elections. Newly elected officers are having a hard time moving into their roles, meeting the companies, scheduling events, and fulfilling their duties as students in 4 months.

<br/>    
* Amend the Constitution so that amendments to the Constitution require a two-thirds vote to pass
    * As we anticipate growth within the organization a more sound amendment approval rating was needed. A two-thirds majority allows us to pass amendments that align with what the organization wants.

<br/> 
* Amend the Constitution so that ratifying the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to pass
    * Again, as we anticipate growth a more sound ratification approval rate was needed.
