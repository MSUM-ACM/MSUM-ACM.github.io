Kyle Fiala, Bell Bank Software Engineer and MSUM Alumni, will be presenting with the President. The workshop will focus on using git through the command line, adding code, committing the code, and working through merge conflicts. If you would like to know more, there is a list of all the commands on the website at msumacm.org/git and we will be willing to go through it later in the Linux Lab.


Students will need to bring their laptop to the event in order to work through the workshop.
