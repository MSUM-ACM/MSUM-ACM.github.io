Day 3 the Web Coding and Design series will be covering 
an informational introduction to preprocessors and how to generate 
clean, maintainable, and stylish Websites at twice the speed.  We will 
be covering the use of Jekyll and Sass to generate HTML and CSS that is 
more cross-browser supportive and much easier and quicker to work with 
than working with generic HTML and CSS.  If you are ready to take your 
Web Coding and Design to the next level, then we will see you there!
