The _Raspberry Pi_ is a capable little credit-card
sized computer that plugs into your TV and
keyboard. It can be used for electronics projects,
setting up webservers and even for regular desktop
computer tasks like spreadsheets, word-processing
or games. It can play high-definition video too.
Many MSUM students use their Raspberry Pis for a
variety of interesting projects. In this workshop
you will be introduced to the Raspberry Pi, learn
about itâ€™s many features and get pointers on how
to start your own Pi projects.
