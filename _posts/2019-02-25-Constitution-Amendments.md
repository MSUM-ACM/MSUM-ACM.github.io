### Do you believe certain sections should be changed? 
If you do then you should vote on the current MSUM ACM Constitutional Amendments.

Current Amendments are as follows:
* Amend the Constitution to one election a year
    * Nearly all organizations at MSUM have yearly elections. Newly elected officers are having a hard time moving into their roles, meeting the companies, scheduling events, and fulfilling their duties as students in 4 months.
     

* Amend the Constitution so that any member, MSUM student or not, may vote, but only MSUM students may hold office
    * As it stands the MSUM ACM allows anyone in the Fargo/Moorhead greater area to be a member, but only students may vote and hold office. As part of a long term proposition to bring members in from MState and other schools we believe any member should be able to have a say!

    
*  Amend the Constitution so that only MSUM students who have been ACM members for a year may be elected to an officer position
    * Currently only members that have been active for a semester may be elected. While this is useful for the old election cycle it is a long term change to help better run the organization. Future officers should know what happened in the past year to better schedule for the next year and help train the next set of officers.

    
* Amend the Constitution so that amendments to the Constitution require a two-thirds vote to pass
    * As we anticipate growth within the organization a more sound amendment approval rating was needed. A two-thirds majority allows us to pass amendments that align with what the organization wants.

    
* Amend the Constitution so that ratifying the Constitution requires a two-thirds vote to pass
    * Again, as we anticipate growth a more sound ratification approval rate was needed.
