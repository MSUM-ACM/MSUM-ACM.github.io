The _Arduino_ is a single-board microcontroller,
intended to make the application of interactive
objects or environments more accessible. We will
be having one of our seniors present his senior
seminar project that he built using an Arduino
board! If you have an Arduino board we would love
to have to attend and present what you use your
Arduino for! This will be a great event to meet
and socialize with a variety of students in our
department and our MSUM ACM Chapter. All students
are welcome!
