As computer scientists and technologists, we can do better than just making
code that works â€“ we can make code that matters.  Diving through science
fiction, ubiquitous computing and a history of cloud technologies as we know
them, Alex will take the audience on a journey to discover the very heart of
why we code.  Alex Brandt is a Cloud Evangelist at Rackspace. Today he speaks
on behalf of Rackspace on a variety of topics. Previously his work focused on
training employees in Cloud, Python, Ruby, and Chef. He regularly consults with
Rackspace customers to develop unique solutions while internally developing new
approaches with evolving technologies. Alex holds a degree in Computer Science
and Physics from Minnesota State University, Moorhead
